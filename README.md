These are examples of my data analyst portfolio projects.

Current projects include:

  CO2 emissions and energy analysis
    Cleaned data from 250+ countries over 40 years of CO2 emissions and energy usage statistics.
    Performed an exploratory analysis on that data.
    Created a tableau dashboard to visualize that data

  Reddit Sentiment Analysis
    Gathered about 70,000 comments from the top 10 posts in 25 subreddits.
    Utilized a Neural Language Processing Toolkit to determine how positive and negative the subreddits are.
    Created a report in Tableau that is published in this repository.
